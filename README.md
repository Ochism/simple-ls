# simple-ls
A short ls style utility created to fill the void on Windows.

This is a small personal project so I can stop typing 

    ls
and getting a friendly reminder that I'm not in Unix right now.

# Features
Prints the contents of the current directory in columns, with an option to add in "hidden" contents. Marks directories with a trailing backslash.

# Installation
This small binary can be installed with the typical

    cargo install --path .
to your cargo bin directory, which for me is 

    %userprofile%\.cargo\bin
which I added to my path so I can use this whereever I want.

# Contributing
Feel free to raise issues or new features requests, I will make an attempt to react as soon as possible
